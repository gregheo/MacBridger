# MacBridger

The final "completed" project from my [360iDev](http://360idev.com/) talk, [Switching Your Brain to Swift](http://gregheo.com/blog/switching-your-brain-to-swift/). Open with Xcode 7 beta!

This project doesn't actually do anything â€” it's just a starter Cocoa application right out of the Xcode template. I was demoing the bridging features from Objective-C to Swift and back so check out the bridging headers and the way the nullability and lightweight generics show up in Swift.
